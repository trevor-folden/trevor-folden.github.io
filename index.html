          <p>Hi, I'm Trevor and am a mechanical engineering student graduating from California State University Chico in
            May 2023.
            I have work experience in machining and 3D Design (Fusion 360 and SolidWorks) both at a Petaluma Startup,
            Zomes, and
            through vibrations research I've done in partnership with one of my professors and the university itself.
            See my attached
            resume for more information about my work experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time I enjoy a variety of hobbies including lockpicking, climbing, Spikeball, and guitar. I also
            enjoy playing
            video games to connect with friends who have moved away and can't be met in person. I also have developed a
            passion for cooking
            (although I need practice) and am an avid 49ers football fan.

            <h3>Coffee Grinder</h3>
            <p>In a group with three other students, we competed in a coffee grinder
              design and fabrication competition (we won). The project itself was open-ended with the only requirements
              being the use of the provided bevel gears and burr and grinder. We used a series of methods including
              manual turning on a lathe, CNC machining, and 3d printing. The system was designed in SolidWorks
              complimented by a full technical writeup accompanied by individual part drawings.</p>

            <h3>Pin Tumbler Lock</h3>
            <p>One of my hobbies is lockpicking so when I was assigned the task of reverse engineering an assembly with
              at least five parts I decided that a 30+ part traditional pin and tumbler lock made the most sense. I
              meticulously disassembled and measured each feature with calipers to bring it to life in SolidWorks. I
              chose to model it after a practice lock for novice lock pickers so that someone unfamiliar with locks
              can easily see the internals. SolidWorks FEA was used to simulate common types of brute force attacks used
              on locks (Eg. bolt cutters or shearing the locking lugs).</p>

            <h3>Hoist Winch</h3>
            <p>As part of the manufacturing processes class, I was tasked with the fabrication of a hoist winch. The
              hoist winch was selected due to the wide variety of manufacturing methods required for the multitude of
              parts. The methods include but are not limited to: casting, manual mill, bending, acetylene torch,
              hydraulic punch, manual lathe, and CNC. One particularly challenging aspect was that I was forced to cut
              threads manually on the lathe as opposed to a tap/die set. After cutting one set of threads we walked over
              and ran the CNC to do the other side of threads much quicker and cleaner. When completed the
              hoist winch is certified for a 1.0 kip vertical load or 1.5 kip horizontal load.</p>

            <h3>Iris Mechanism</h3>
            <p>This iris mechanism is a small project I did in my free time outside of classes. The mechanism itself is
              my own design, I've seen people use similar mechanisms for novelty ring boxes. I decided to try and design
              my own take on the mechanism because of how alluring the movement was. I sketched it, designed it in
              SolidWorks, and once it cools down (it's 115 in Chico over the summer) 3d print it. Eventually, I would
              like to integrate my design into something practical and fabricate the mechanism out of high-quality
              materials as opposed to the cheapest PLA money can buy.</p>

            <h3>Trebuchet</h3>
            <p>The trebuchet was a fever dream that I undertook with a few of my friends. I was the lead “engineer” on
              the project. We bought some supplies and used my dad's tools to
              construct this 15-foot wooden monstrosity. We built it in my driveway and proceed to carry it about a mile
              to a local middle school in the dead of night. The first two launches were moderately successful hurtling
              a tennis ball which I have to assume was traveling over Mach 3 over half the length of a soccer field.
              Tragically on the third launch, the trebuchet realized that it was too powerful for our world and
              self-destructed. The lesson here is one of planning, though I must note a well-planned, well-executed
              trebuchet would have taken much longer and been substantially less fun for my friends who are not
              engineering inclined. </p>

            <h3>Classical Guitar</h3>
            <p>I took classical guitar lessons for 10 years starting at the age of 8, since then I’ve kept up learning
              new songs and playing when I have the time and it has become one of my favorite hobbies. The link below
              sends
              you to my YouTube channel where I’ve posted to showcase my ability. While classical guitar is inherently a
              challenging skill in itself to learn, I would argue the more impressive feat is the time dedicated.<br>See
              video attached. </p>
